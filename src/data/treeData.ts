    question: 'What is the average time complexity for searching a key in a balanced Binary Search Tree?',
    options: ['O(log N)', 'O(N^2)', 'O(1)', 'O(N log N)'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Because search cuts the search space in half at each step, balanced BST search runs in O(log N) average time.'

    question: 'Which traversal of a Binary Search Tree (BST) produces the elements in strictly ASCENDING sorted order?',
    options: ['Preorder', 'Inorder', 'Postorder', 'Level Order'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Because Inorder visits (Left → Root → Right), it visits all smaller elements first, then the root, then larger elements, producing sorted order.'

    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Preorder traversal processes the Root first, followed by left and right subtrees.'
